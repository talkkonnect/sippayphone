Compatibility
-------------
Developing on Raspberry PI 3 (model B+)

Story and Inspiration
---------------------
I want to use a Raspberry Pi to build an IP Enabled SIP phone with LCD and keyboard and
house it into old vintage Thailand TOT Public Card Payphone as shown in the Picture.

This is a work in progress and will take some time. Ultimately it should be a working phone
with hook, ringer, number keypad, lcd screen and operate as a sip client connected to my
FreeSWITCH server.
